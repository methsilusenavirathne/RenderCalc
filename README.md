# RenderCalc

RenderCalc is a Blender addon that helps you calculate and optimize rendering times for your Blender projects. With RenderCalc, you can quickly estimate the time required to render your project, identify which scenes or objects are causing long render times, and tweak your settings to achieve faster rendering times.

## Installation

To install RenderCalc, simply download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/yourusername/RenderCalc/releases) page and follow these steps:

1. Download the addon.py file from https://github.com/methsilusenavirathne/RenderCalc/releases/tag/RenderCalc
2. Open Blender.
3. Go to Edit > Preferences > Add-ons.
4. Click the "Install" button and select theaddon.py file.
5. Enable the RenderCalc add-on by checking the box next to it.
6. The addon will be appeared in the side panel of Blender UI.

## Usage

To use RenderCalc, open your Blender project and click the "RenderCalc" button in the Render Properties panel. This will open the RenderCalc interface, where you can select your render settings and calculate the rendercost for your blender project when using your fiverr gig.

RenderCalc also includes advanced features for optimizing your rendering times, such as the ability to identify and isolate problematic scenes or objects, adjust render settings to reduce render times, and report your render cost data for further analysis.

**The addon is still on its beta stage and only supports gpu render for the current frame to estimate render time. We are looking forward to add CPU rendering too.**
