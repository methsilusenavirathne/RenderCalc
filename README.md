# RenderCalc

RenderCalc is a Blender addon that helps you calculate and optimize rendering times for your Blender projects. With RenderCalc, you can quickly estimate the time required to render your project, identify which scenes or objects are causing long render times, and tweak your settings to achieve faster rendering times.

## Installation

To install RenderCalc, simply download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/yourusername/RenderCalc/releases) page and follow these steps:

1. Open Blender.
2. Go to Edit > Preferences > Add-ons.
3. Click the "Install" button and select the downloaded ZIP file.
4. Enable the RenderCalc add-on by checking the box next to it.

## Usage

To use RenderCalc, open your Blender project and click the "RenderCalc" button in the Render Properties panel. This will open the RenderCalc interface, where you can select your render settings and calculate the estimated render time.

RenderCalc also includes advanced features for optimizing your rendering times, such as the ability to identify and isolate problematic scenes or objects, adjust render settings to reduce render times, and export your render time data for further analysis.
